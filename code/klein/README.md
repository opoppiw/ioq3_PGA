## Klein Plane-Based Geometric Algebra Library
The Klein Library is originally written in C++. Since the ioquake3 project is entirely written in C, C wrappers had to be written.
The Klein library C++ source can be found in the `src` directory and the C wrappers can be found in the `wrappers` directory.
